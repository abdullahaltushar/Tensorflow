# Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system; however, this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and train machine learning models. See the TensorFlow documentation for complete details on the broader TensorFlow system.
